##### Biography

I received my B.A. degrees with the highest honors in physics and mathematics from Vanderbilt University in 2023, where I worked with Prof. Jared Speck on PDE analysis in relativistic fluids and Prof. Kalman Varga on computational cavity QED. I joined Cornell's physics PhD program in 2023 and the numerical relativity group in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. Nils Deppe.
