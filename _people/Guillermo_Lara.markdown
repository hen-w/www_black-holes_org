Numerical modelling of binary black holes in beyond GR theories

##### Biography

My name is Guillermo Lara and since 2022 I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam, Germany. I obtained my PhD in Astroparticle Physics at the the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA, Trieste, Italy) under the supervision of Prof. Enrico Barausse, where I worked on the strong-field regime of gravity in theories beyond General Relativity.

My current research focuses on implementing recently developed numerical relativity techniques to study the phenomenology black holes in theories beyond GR (e.g. black holes with additional scalar hair in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity).
