##### Research Projects

My investigations deal with numerical simulations of black hole solutions of the
gravitational Field Equations for theories beyond General Relativity. I use SpEC (Spectral
Einstein Code) to construct and study rotating black holes in beyond-GR theories
including but not limited to its implications in perturbation theory, thermodynamics etc.

##### Biography

I received a B.Tech in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering and followed it up with an MS
in the Physics of Dynamical Systems in 2019. My research involved understanding the dynamical
phenomenon in Kerr Geodesics. Now I am a PhD candidate at UMississippi under Leo Stein carrying out
research in Numerical Relativity.
