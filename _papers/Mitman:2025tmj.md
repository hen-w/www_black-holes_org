  The Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration's code SpEC can now
  routinely simulate binary black hole mergers undergoing $\sim25$
  orbits, with the longest simulations undergoing nearly $\sim180$
  orbits. While this sounds impressive, the mismatch between the
  highest resolutions for this long simulation is
  $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. Meanwhile, the mismatch between resolutions
  for the more typical simulations tends to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$,
  despite the resolutions being similar to the long simulations'. In
  this note, we explain why mismatch alone gives an incomplete picture
  of code -- and waveform -- quality, especially in the context of
  providing waveform templates for LISA and 3G detectors, which
  require templates with $\mathcal{O}(10^{3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{5})$
  orbits. We argue that to ready the GW community for the sensitivity
  of future detectors, numerical relativity groups must be aware of
  this caveat, and also run future simulations with at least three
  resolutions to properly assess waveform accuracy.
